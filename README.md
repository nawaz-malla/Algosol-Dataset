# 🔁 LLM-Based Translation of Ethereum Solidity Contracts to Algorand Python

This repository contains a collection of **equivalent smart contracts** written in both **Ethereum Solidity** and **Algorand Python (ARC4)**. These contracts were developed as part of the research article titled:

**"LLM-Based Translation of Ethereum Solidity Contracts to Algorand Python"**

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the feasibility and performance of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for translating smart contracts between different blockchain platforms.

This repository includes:

- ✅ Original smart contracts written in **Solidity** for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- 🔁 Their translated equivalents in **Algorand Python** (using ARC4 conventions).
- 💬 The **LLM prompts** used for the translation process.

---

## 🔍 Research Context

This repository supports the reproducibility and transparency of our study on **cross-chain smart contract translation** using LLMs. The research explores:

- Structural and syntactic differences between Solidity and Algorand Python.
- LLM capabilities in understanding and converting contract logic.
- Challenges and limitations encountered during translation.

---

## 📌 Use Cases

This work can be useful for:

- Blockchain developers migrating contracts between chains.
- Researchers studying LLMs and formal code translation.
- Projects aiming for cross-chain interoperability.
